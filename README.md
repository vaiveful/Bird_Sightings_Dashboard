# Bird_Sightings_Dashboard
This Power BI report tracks recent notable bird sightings in Spain using data from the eBird API. Python scripts extract eBird data and export it to CSV, which is then combined with my personal observation data. The dashboard visualizes recent sightings, compares them with my personal Life List, highlights matches, and flags any exotic species.
